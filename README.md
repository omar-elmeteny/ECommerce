# CSEN503 Computer Networks Project (E-Commerce Site)

## About

The objective of this project is to obtain an experience in developing a network application based on the 
client/server architecture. We build a web application that is used as a simple shopping 
website. The website allows the users to lookup products descriptions, types, manufacturers... etc. Users 
can create an account, add items to their “cart” and search for products.

Technologies used: Mongodb, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Nodejs.
